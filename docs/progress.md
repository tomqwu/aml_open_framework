# Project Progress

Snapshot of where the AML Open Framework is as of 2026-05-07. This document is a fact-based audit of what's shipped, not a roadmap or marketing piece. For "what's next?" see [`getting-started.md`](getting-started.md) and the [Changelog](../CHANGELOG.md).

> **Round 12 — Lineage end-to-end** (#222–#232) shipped 2026-05-07: walk_lineage now surfaces rendered SQL + source path + schema hash + rule_version on every event + matched_row_ids per alert. Three dashboard pages (Audit & Evidence, Case Investigation, Data Integration) extended; new Lineage Explorer page (#32) ships the deep walk-back. Landing site adds a third Lineage hero + research deep-dive + technical deck slide. Tests grew 1,985 → ~2,020.

## Round-by-Round Delivery

### Round 5 — Payment Rails Ingestion (5 PRs, ~16 days)

Goal: ingest the messages banks actually move money with, after SWIFT's MX-only cutover (2025-11-22).

| PR | Feature | Driving signal |
|---|---|---|
| #56 | ISO 20022 `pacs.008` + `pacs.009` ingestion adapter | SWIFT MX-only cutover |
| #57 | FATF R.16 Travel Rule field validator (`python_ref` callable) | FATF Feb 2026 plenary deficiency call-out |
| #58 | ISO 20022 purpose-code typology library (4 reusable snippets) | ExternalPurpose1Code now mandatory |
| #59 | `pain.001` corporate-batch ingestion | Wolfsberg Feb 2026 correspondent-banking guidance |
| #60 | `pacs.004` payment-return + return-reason mining library (3 snippets) | UK PSR APP-fraud reimbursement (Apr 2026 full effect) |

**Result**: framework can natively consume every major ISO 20022 message type. Travel-rule completeness is automated. Two reusable spec-library files ship 7 typology rule snippets keyed to FATF / FinCEN / UK PSR / Wolfsberg guidance.

### Round 6 — Case Management as First-Class Surface (5 PRs, ~17 days)

Goal: make investigation (not alert) the unit of analyst work, per FinCEN's 2024 effectiveness rule.

| PR | Feature | Driving signal |
|---|---|---|
| #61 | Investigation aggregator (`cases/aggregator.py`) | FinCEN NPRM measures effectiveness per investigation |
| #62 | Multi-tenant dashboard surfacing (sidebar selector) | API had it; dashboard didn't |
| #63 | SLA timer + escalation engine (`cases/sla.py`) | FCA Mar 2026 Dear CEO letter on SAR backlogs |
| #64 | Case-to-STR auto-bundling (`cases/str_bundle.py`) | Wolfsberg Feb 2026 "submission-ready packages" |
| #65 | Investigations dashboard page #24 | Operator surface for the above |

**Result**: cases now aggregate into investigations with deterministic IDs. Live SLA tracking surfaces backlog state per-queue. Self-contained STR ZIPs bundle narrative + goAML XML + Mermaid diagrams + manifest hash. New dashboard page consolidates the workflow.

### Workflow Polish (4 PRs)

| PR | Feature |
|---|---|
| #67 | README refactor 582 → 123 lines + Getting Started guide + Dashboard Tour + Jurisdictions doc |
| #69 | `aml --help` typer/click compatibility fix; crypto_vasp doc gap |
| #70 | Mobile-responsive dashboard overlay (closes #66) |
| #71 | Workflow audit: executive font scale + 4 pages made interactive + missing pages registered |
| #72 | Synthetic data enriched with ISO 20022 fields + planted INVS positive |

**Result**: new-user onboarding path is 15 minutes. Mobile viewports work. Executive personas (SVP/CTO/CCO/VP/Director) get auto-scaled fonts. Default `aml run --seed 42` demo now exercises all Round 5/6 features.

### Round 7 — Research-driven defensive layer (5 PRs, ~21 days)

Goal: ship the top-5 features ranked by impact ÷ effort in the [2026-04 competitive positioning research](research/2026-04-competitive-positioning.md). All five anchored to a 2026 regulatory clock the research surfaced as load-bearing.

| PR | Feature | Driving signal |
|---|---|---|
| #74 | Regulatory-change diff watcher (`compliance/regwatch.py`) | FinCEN BOI Mar 2025 narrowing + April 2026 NPRM 12-month tail |
| #75 | AMLA STR/RTS effectiveness telemetry pack (`metrics/outcomes.py`) | AMLA RTS due 2026-07-10 + FinCEN NPRM enumerates same metrics |
| #76 | TBML + UK APP-fraud example specs | FATF Feb 2026 plenary + PSR Apr 2026 full-effect reimbursement |
| #77 | PSD3 / Verification-of-Payee adapter (DRAFT) | PSD3/PSR Council/Parliament agreement end-Q2 2026; VoP applies +24 months |
| #78 | FINTRAC pre-examination audit pack (`generators/audit_pack.py`) | FINTRAC January 2026 examination manual update |

**Result**: framework now has a defensive layer that sits *above* the spec — drift detection against silently-changing regulator pages, regulator-format effectiveness JSON, jurisdiction-templated examination evidence packs. This is the layer commercial vendors don't ship because they own the rule library themselves; the framework needs it precisely because it doesn't.

**Cross-feature integration** (closed in Dashboard Workflow & Design plan, 2026-04-28):
- Dashboard page surfacing the outcomes funnel ✅ Phase B-2
- Dashboard panel for regwatch drift findings ✅ Phase B-2
- One-click audit-pack download from Audit & Evidence ✅ Phase B-3
- VoP outcomes panel on Sanctions Screening ✅ Phase B-3

### Dashboard Workflow & Design plan (8 PRs, 2026-04-27 → 2026-04-28)

Goal: ensure proper workflow + design across the dashboard. Audit identified 5 hidden modules, broken cross-page navigation, muddled persona arcs, and crash-prone empty-state behavior.

| PR | Phase | Feature |
|---|---|---|
| #80 | A | Cross-cutting helpers: `link_to_page`, `read_param`, `consume_param`, `severity_color`, `sla_band_color`, `empty_state` |
| #81 | B-1 | SLA timer + STR-bundle download on case-facing pages (#4, #21, #17) |
| #82 | B-2 | Effectiveness funnel on Executive Dashboard + regulation-drift panel on Audit & Evidence |
| #83 | B-3 | FINTRAC audit-pack download on Audit & Evidence + VoP outcomes on Sanctions Screening |
| #84 | C | Cross-page drill-downs / deep links — Alert Queue + Network Explorer + Customer 360 + Executive |
| #85 | D | Persona workflow rebalance — every persona ≤8 pages, coherent task arcs |
| #86 | E | Empty-state defenses on engine-side pages (#5, #10, #11) + design consistency test guards |
| #87 | E follow-up | `risk_color()` resolver + 7 pages migrated off inline color dicts; test ALLOWED set drained |

**Result**: every Round-6/7 module is now reachable from the dashboard (was the original Phase B goal). Cross-entity drill-downs eliminate the audit's worst dead-ends (~20-30s saved per drill, dozens per shift). Three pages that crashed on degenerate specs now degrade gracefully. Color/SLA palette has a single source of truth — any new inline color dict fails CI. Tests grew 1089 → 1161 across the 8 PRs.

### Dashboard UX + GenAI push (12 PRs, 2026-04-30)

Goal: close the remaining clickability/colour/cross-link gaps from a fresh page-by-page audit, then surface the dashboard's existing GenAI substrate as a co-pilot on every page. Single day, 12 PRs auto-merging on green per the project memory rule.

| PR | Workstream |
|---|---|
| #150 | PR-A · Row-click drill-through across 5 triage tables (Alert Queue, Customer 360, My Queue, Investigations, BOI Workflow) |
| #151 | PR-B · Severity + RAG cell colouring on 6 read-only tables (centralised Styler helpers — `severity_cell_style`, `rag_cell_style`, `metric_gradient_style`, `event_type_cell_style`) |
| #152 | PR-C · Cross-page navigation + research-link sweep — `see_also_footer` on 6 pages |
| #154 | PR-D · Empty-state polish — `empty_state()` helper applied across 6 pages |
| #153 | PR-E · Chart palette + tooltips + SLA-band shading + best-F1 annotation |
| #155 | PR-F · Regulation citation hyperlinks via new `citation_link()` helper |
| #156 | PR-G · KPI card drill-through on My Queue / BOI Workflow / Alert Queue |
| #157 | PR-H · ID-linking sweep + Tuning Lab `rule_id` deep-link reader |
| #158 | PR-I · **Metrics Taxonomy** catalogue page (#28) — sister to Typology Catalogue, browseable definitional view of every metric the spec declares |
| #159 | PR-J · `dashboard-tour.md` drift fix + `test_dashboard_tour_coverage.py` prevention pattern. Closed Issue #68. |
| #160 | PR-K · **GenAI Assistant MVP** — sidebar panel on every dashboard page via a single line in `page_header()`. New `assistant/` sibling module to `narratives/` with template/ollama/openai backends. Spec-configurable audit log via `program.ai_audit_log: hash_only \| full_text`. New page #29 for backend status + transcript + run-level audit trail. |
| #161 | PR-L · Docs sync (this snapshot, README, spec-reference) |

**Result**: dashboard now ships with click-everywhere navigation, a coherent colour discipline (RAG / severity / SLA from centralised tokens, no inline hex), an audit-doc-defendable Metrics Taxonomy reference, and a GenAI co-pilot that mounts on every page without per-page edits. The `narratives/` substrate that previously powered only the Case Investigation STR drafter is now reused for the assistant — same Citation model, same backend factory, same audit-log discipline. Tests grew 1,646 → 1,750 (+104) across the 12 PRs.

### Brand + UX consolidation (7 PRs, 2026-05-01)

Goal: port the landing-site brand DNA (deck → dashboard CSS), then absorb the regressions that surfaced once the topbar / Today-hero rebuild went live. Smaller wave than PR-A→L; mostly CSS, fixes, and one e2e expansion.

| PR | Workstream |
|---|---|
| #162 | PR-M · Port deck DNA to live CSS (typography scale, spacing, accent ramp) |
| #163 | PR-N · Landing-site brand applied — wordmark + cream/orange palette |
| #164 | PR-O · Preserve sidebar expand control after collapse (regression from N) |
| #165 | PR-Q · Landing-style topbar + ivory sidebar + Today hero |
| #166 | PR-R · Fix Today cards crashing for VP / SVP / Director / Developer / FinTech personas (KeyError on persona-filtered metrics) |
| #167 | PR-S · Fix `link_to_page()` crash when target page is hidden by persona filter |
| #168 | PR-T · e2e persona × page coverage matrix + HTML-leak detector + KPI render fix |

**Result**: dashboard chrome now matches the landing-site brand. Two persona-side crashes that surfaced after the topbar/Today-hero rebuild are fixed and protected by a 31×12 persona-page e2e coverage matrix. The HTML-leak detector catches a class of bug where Streamlit components render unrendered Markdown/HTML strings into the page (a regression vector that's easy to introduce when porting CSS-heavy components). Tests grew 1,750 → 1,791 (+41) across the 7 PRs; test files went 56 → 90 (the e2e expansion split into per-persona modules). Three follow-up README polish commits (`Where this fits in your stack`, `In-bank, not SaaS`, Quickstart venv guidance) shipped directly to main outside the PR cadence.

### Round 10 — Data layer hardening (7 PRs, 2026-05-02)

Goal: close the gap between the "Data is the AML problem" whitepaper's claims (`docs/research/2026-05-aml-data-problem.md`, shipped in PR #174) and what the code actually backs. A code audit against the doc found 3 STRONG / 5 PARTIAL / 3 STUB verdicts across 11 DATA-N sections; this round addresses the 6 with material gaps.

| PR | Workstream | DATA-N | Whitepaper claim before / after |
|---|---|---|---|
| #177 | PR-DATA-1 · Fail-closed contract validation | DATA-1 | "Validator fails closed" — partial → **strong** |
| #178 | PR-DATA-2 · pKYC integration + per-attribute freshness pinning (`max_staleness_days` + `last_refreshed_at_column`) | DATA-2 | "Per-attribute freshness pinning" — stub → **strong** |
| #179 | PR-DATA-4 · Per-decision audit metadata + `walk_lineage()` helper | DATA-4 | "Walk-back from any KPI to producing run + rule version + spec hash + input file hashes" — partial → **strong** |
| #180 | PR-DATA-9 · Real STR/SAR filing-latency capture (filing sidecars) | DATA-9 | "STR filing-latency p95 is a first-class metric" — proxy → **real wall-clock** |
| #181 | PR-DATA-8 · MLRO attestation workflow + `aml run --strict` gate | DATA-8 | "MLRO signs against Manifest hash" — stub → **strong** (hash-chained `attestations.jsonl`) |
| #182 | PR-DATA-10a · `information_sharing` spec syntax + `aml share-pattern` / `aml verify-pattern` CLI | DATA-10 | "Cross-bank info-sharing reference surface" — sandbox-only-as-library → **policy boundary in spec + CLI seam** |
| #183 | PR-DATA-10b · Information Sharing dashboard (page #31) | DATA-10 | Operational view (declared partners + recent share-pattern artifacts) |

**Result**: 6 DATA-N sections promoted from stub/partial to strong. New module `attestations/` (17 modules total). New engine submodule `engine/freshness.py`. New cases sidecar `cases/<case_id>__filing.json`. Three new CLI commands (`attest`, `share-pattern`, `verify-pattern`); two new audit-event types (`contract_violation`, `pkyc_trigger`). Audit-ledger schema bumped to version 2 with `rule_version` stamped on every `case_opened` event. Tests grew 1,791 → 1,848 (+57) across 6 new test files; test files went 90 → 96. The `aml run --strict` opt-in flag refuses to execute against unattested specs — the first concrete Manifest-version gate the framework ships.

The whitepaper's three remaining claims (DATA-3 reconciliation, DATA-5 sovereignty, DATA-11 spec-as-data-contract) were already STRONG; DATA-6 (AI presumes data) is closed transitively by PR-DATA-1's fail-closed validation; DATA-7 (Engineering vs Compliance ownership) is technical-pattern-strong via the data-contract architecture, with the residual gap being organisational and out of code scope.

### Round 11 — Hardening + API + charts + docs (10 PRs, 2026-05-04 → 2026-05-05)

Goal: close the residual gaps surfaced by a fail-closed / compliance-posture review (#204-#211), finish the chart-library migration started in Round-9, harden the REST API surface for production deploys, and unify the 21 stale page/test/jurisdiction counts that had drifted across docs and the landing site.

| PR | Workstream |
|---|---|
| #213 | `fix(api)`: gate demo auth in production — refuse demo-mode credentials when `ENV=production` |
| #214 | `fix(data)`: fail closed on unloadable data contracts (raise instead of silent fallback) |
| #215 | `fix(engine)`: fail closed on `python_ref` scorer failure by default — opt-in to soft-fail |
| #216 | Compliance hardening — gap-review batch closing #204-#211: SQL proxy dispatch correctness, strict CSV row validation, dashboard page-inventory drift test, jurisdiction overclaim cleanup, citation-URL completeness (PCMLTFR/OSFI/SEMA/FCA/PSR/OFSI), sanctions alias persistence, audit/filing JSONL append-only ledger, dashboard data-source mode tracking |
| #217 | `fix(charts)`: finish ECharts + AG Grid migration — zero Plotly references, zero `st.dataframe` calls remain |
| #218 | `fix(api)`: harden uploads + OIDC — strict audience validation, configurable artifact root for run persistence, Helm `values.yaml` keys + deployment template, `.env.example` + deployment.md updates, +89 lines of new API tests |
| #218 | `docs`: refresh all docs and landing site — 21 stale metrics unified across README/landing/dashboard-tour/getting-started/CONTRIBUTING/CHANGELOG/progress.md (page count 31→32, test count 1,790/1,910/1,850 → 1,980, jurisdictions claim → "5 jurisdictions with 10 bundled specs", deck slide page-counts) |
| #219 | `fix(ci)`: filter the exact transient browser-only `Failed to fetch` pageerror in dashboard e2e while preserving Streamlit exception and other pageerror failures |

**Result**: the framework now fails *closed* across three more boundaries (demo-auth in prod, data-contract load, python_ref scorer error) — completing the policy that started with PR-DATA-1. Every chart and every table on the dashboard is now ECharts / AG Grid (no Plotly, no `st.dataframe`). The REST API artifact-root configuration unblocks production K8s deploys where pod ephemerality requires runs to persist outside `/tmp`. Twenty-one stale numeric claims across docs were reconciled in a single sweep so future drift is detectable; CI flake on transient browser fetch errors no longer noise-trips the e2e gate. Tests grew 1,848 → 1,985 (+137) across 10 PRs.

### Round 12 — End-to-end lineage (11 PRs, 2026-05-07)

Goal: close the gap between "we have a hash-chained audit log" and "we can walk an examiner from any alert to its source row." Eleven PRs across backend (Phase A), dashboard surfacing (Phase B), a new dedicated page (Phase C), and marketing (Phase D).

| PR | Phase | Workstream |
|---|---|---|
| #222 | A | PR-LIN-1 · Surface rendered SQL via `walk_lineage()` (lifts `rules/<rule_id>.sql` into the chain dict) |
| #223 | A | PR-LIN-2 · Stamp source path + schema_columns + schema_hash on `record_input()` (8 source types via new `infer_source_paths()` helper) |
| #224 | A | PR-LIN-3 · Stamp `rule_version` on every decision event (escalate / closed / rule_failed), not just `case_opened` |
| #225 | A | PR-LIN-4 · Capture `matched_row_ids` per alert across `aggregation_window` / `custom_sql` / `list_match` / `network_pattern` (python_ref deferred — would break callable contract) |
| #226 | B | PR-LIN-5 · Audit & Evidence — SQL viewer + matched-row grid + source-provenance columns on the existing lineage walk-back panel |
| #227 | B | PR-LIN-6 · Case Investigation — "Why this fired" panel above Transaction Timeline (matched-row count + severity + rule_version + collapsible rule SQL) |
| #228 | B | PR-LIN-7 · Data Integration — Source → Contract → DuckDB Table mapping section; DATA-3 / DATA-4 status flipped from "stub" to "shipped" |
| #229 | C | PR-LIN-8 · New Lineage Explorer page #32 — Mermaid graph + run anchors + source provenance + rule SQL + matched rows + decision timeline + JSON download. Registered in app.py + e2e PAGES + analyst persona |
| #230 | D | PR-LIN-9 · Landing page — third hero "Trace every alert. Down to the row." + new research card + `#/research/lineage` hash route |
| #231 | D | PR-LIN-10 · `research/lineage.html` deep-dive — 7-link evidence chain, 12 stamped fields, regulator anchors (BCBS 239 P3-P5, FinCEN April 2026 NPRM, SR 26-2, OSFI E-23) |
| #232 | D | PR-LIN-11 · New technical slide `24-lineage-walkback.html` (Act IV) + by-the-numbers slide refresh (test count 1,632 → 2,000+, pages 26 → 32, specs 9 → 10, CLI 24 → 38, licence MIT → Apache 2.0) |

**Result**: the audit question "show me why this alert fired" now has a one-paste-box answer. The 7-link chain (source file → contract → DuckDB table → rule → alert with `matched_row_ids` → case → STR) is hash-stamped end-to-end, reproducible from spec + data + as_of, and downloadable as JSON for offline review. Three existing dashboard pages got the relevant slice of the chain inline; the new Lineage Explorer page consolidates the deeper drill. The 12-field per-decision payload is now the framework's documented audit shape. DATA-3 (cross-system reconciliation) and DATA-4 (lineage walk-back from KPI) are shipped, not stubs. Tests grew 1,985 → ~2,020 (+35) across 11 PRs.

### Round 13 — Lineage coverage gaps · dashboard, exports, CLI, API (9 PRs, 2026-05-07)

Goal: close the gap between "the lineage primitives exist" and "every surface a regulator, analyst, or integration consumer might touch shows the chain." A 3-pronged audit after Round 12 found that 14 of 32 dashboard pages carried zero lineage, all 3 regulator-facing exports were lineage-blind, and there were no CLI commands or API endpoints for lineage at all.

| PR | Phase | Workstream |
|---|---|---|
| #237 | E | PR-LIN-12 · Triage path lineage — Alert Queue + My Queue + Analyst Review Queue gain `Matched rows` + `Rule version` columns / Source-lineage expander; Case Investigation deep-links to Lineage Explorer |
| #238 | E | PR-LIN-13 · Entity-context lineage — Investigations + Network Explorer + Customer 360 gain inline columns + per-case Lineage Explorer deep-links |
| #239 | E | PR-LIN-14 · Analytical-arc lineage — Rule Performance gains `Rule version` (via `rule_version_hash`) column; Sanctions Screening gains `Source rowid` from `matched_row_ids[0]`; Run History + Tuning Lab gain Lineage Explorer pointers |
| #240 | E | PR-LIN-15 · Headline + AI lineage — Today + Executive Dashboard + AI Assistant gain Lineage Explorer entry-points; AI Assistant citations get a "Verify against audit trail" deep-link per `referenced_case_id` |
| #241 | F | PR-LIN-16 · STR bundle `manifest.json` carries a `case_lineage` block (rule_version + matched_row_ids + per-contract source_path/schema_hash/content_hash). Regulator extracting the ZIP can answer "which rule version, which source rows" without re-running |
| #242 | F | PR-LIN-17 · Audit pack ships a new `case_lineage_summary.json` section. FINTRAC examiner gets the chain per case from the bundle alone |
| #243 | F | PR-LIN-18 · Effectiveness pack — Control Output Quality pillar gains `alerts_by_rule_with_lineage` finding (per-rule alert_count + rule_version + sample_matched_rows). Closes FinCEN April 2026 NPRM standard's "show your work" gap on aggregate metrics |
| #244 | G | PR-LIN-19 · CLI — `aml lineage <case_id>` (JSON or table) + `aml verify-decisions [--expected-hash]`. Wraps `walk_lineage()` and `AuditLedger.verify_decisions()` for scriptable use; tamper detection exits non-zero |
| #245 | G | PR-LIN-20 · API — `GET /api/v1/runs/{run_id}/cases/{case_id}/lineage`. Auth gated; tenant-isolated; 404s on unknown run / missing run_dir / unknown case_id; 401 without auth |

**Result**: lineage is now reachable from every dashboard surface (14 pages updated), every regulator-facing export (STR bundle / FINTRAC audit pack / FinCEN effectiveness pack), the CLI (`aml lineage`, `aml verify-decisions`), and the API (`GET .../cases/{id}/lineage`). The audit chain is no longer "primitives in the data" — it's "addressable from anywhere a consumer might be." Tests grew ~2,020 → 2,050 (+30) across 9 PRs.

### Round 14 — Final lineage coverage audit (2 PRs, 2026-05-07)

Goal: after Round 13, audit every dashboard page for lineage suitability and close real gaps. User asked for completeness; the honest answer is *coverage by relevance, not by URL count*. A 3-pronged audit of the 16 pages NOT touched by Rounds 12+13 produced this verdict:

| PR | Workstream |
|---|---|
| #249 | PR-LIN-23 · 5 case-aware pages get lineage hooks: Risk Assessment (row-click drill → Alert Queue), Model Performance + Comparative Analytics + FinTech Cockpit + Metrics Taxonomy (`→ Open Lineage Explorer` pointer). 12 new ALLOWED_GRACEFUL_GAPS entries for personas seeing these pages without Lineage Explorer in their nav. |
| #250 | PR-LIN-24 · Round 14 docs section (this entry) + CHANGELOG block explaining the coverage policy. |

**Pages explicitly excluded — 10 pages** that carry no case-level domain to walk back from. Listed here so future audits don't re-litigate:

| Page | Why no lineage |

**Already covered before this round (1 page):** 25_BOI_Workflow drills via Customer 360, which has the Round-12 lineage panel. Chain is complete.

**Result**: every page where lineage is *meaningful* now reaches Lineage Explorer. The 10 excluded pages remain link-free deliberately — adding generic pointers there would dilute the meaning of "lineage." After Round 14, the lineage workstream is **closed.** Future page additions follow the established pattern (link_to_page with case_id when available, generic pointer otherwise). Tests grew 2,050 → 2,055 (+5) across 2 PRs.

### Round 15 — Azure bank-deploy stack (4 PRs, 2026-05-07)

Goal: make the framework deployable on Microsoft Azure with zero static secrets. After Rounds 12–14 closed the lineage workstream, the user asked to integrate with Azure platform tools/systems. Azure spans 7+ surfaces (data, identity, secrets, deploy, AI, SIEM, governance); user picked all four high-value buckets and split them across two rounds — bank-deploy now (Round 15), AI + Sentinel + Purview later (Round 16).

| PR | Workstream |
|---|---|
| #251 | PR-AZ-1 · Data sources — `azure_blob` + `adls` (DuckDB azure extension over `abfss://` URIs) + `synapse` + `azuresql` (pyodbc with ActiveDirectoryMsi auth on AKS workload identity). 4 new dispatch branches in `resolve_source()` + 4 new `infer_source_paths()` cases so the Round-12 lineage chain picks up Azure-sourced runs unchanged. New `[azure]` extras in pyproject.toml. |
| #252 | PR-AZ-2 · `aml_framework.secrets.SecretsProvider` — Key Vault first, env-var fallback. DefaultAzureCredential picks up workload identity on AKS; falls back gracefully when SDK init fails. JWT_SECRET, OPENAI_API_KEY, demo-user passwords all routed through the provider. Naming translation `_` → `-` for Key Vault compatibility. |
| #253 | PR-AZ-3 · AKS Helm chart additions — `azure:` block in values.yaml (5 optional fields), workload-identity ServiceAccount + pod label rendered conditionally, AZURE_KEY_VAULT_NAME / AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME / AZURE_SYNAPSE_CONN / AZURE_SQL_CONN env vars threaded to API + dashboard pods. New `values-azure.example.yaml` with az CLI cookbook. New "Deploying on Azure / AKS" section in `docs/deployment.md`. |
| #254 | PR-AZ-4 · Round 15 docs sync (this entry) — progress.md + CHANGELOG + README + architecture.md. |

**Result**: a regulated bank with an Azure tenant can deploy this on AKS today. Workload identity removes static credentials end-to-end; Key Vault houses the JWT signing key + OpenAI API key; Entra ID OIDC handles API auth via the existing generic OIDC support (no code changes — config only). Lineage chains from Round 12 work unchanged on Azure-sourced runs (`source_path: azure_blob:abfss://...`). Tests grew 2,055 → 2,076 (+21) across 4 PRs.

**Round 16 (queued, not shipped):** Azure OpenAI as a 4th assistant backend; Microsoft Sentinel SIEM via Log Analytics Data Collector; Azure Monitor / Application Insights via OpenTelemetry; Microsoft Purview lineage push via Atlas API. The Purview piece is the **differentiated** one — pushing `walk_lineage()` chains to Purview means AML lineage shows up in the same governance pane as a bank's other data assets.

### Round 16 — Land on the user's Azure backbone, Phase A (4 PRs, 2026-05-07)

Goal: deploy the framework on the user's prebuilt landing zone at [tomqwu/cloud_landing_zone_for_ai_coding](https://github.com/tomqwu/cloud_landing_zone_for_ai_coding). Round 15 shipped the AKS Helm chart for self-managed Azure / on-prem K8s; this round adds the **Container Apps** path that the landing zone constrains us to.

Surprise constraint: the landing zone's `CLAUDE.md` explicitly forbids AKS — *"compute: only Azure Functions Flex Consumption, Container Apps, or Static Web Apps."* Round 15's Helm chart still ships for non-landing-zone deployments; Round 16 Phase A adds an alternative.

| PR | Workstream |
|---|---|
| #255 | PR-AZ-5 · Terraform deployment module under `deploy/terraform/` calling `module.onboard` from the landing zone (vends RG + UAMI + per-app Key Vault + FICs). Provisions Postgres Flexible Server B1ms with Entra-ID-only auth, Container Apps for API + dashboard with UAMI assigned, diagnostic settings → platform Log Analytics workspace, Key Vault secret placeholders for JWT-SECRET / OPENAI-API-KEY (with `lifecycle.ignore_changes` so operator-set values survive). |
| #256 | PR-AZ-6 · GitHub Actions pipeline `deploy-azure-landing-zone.yml` — three jobs: `plan` (PR comments) → `build_and_push` (ACR via OIDC) → `apply` (gated by `platform-prod` Environment, with revision-rollover nudge + `/health` smoke check). All auth via federated identity credential — no secrets stored in the repo. **Removed in Round 18 (PR #295):** Azure deploy is now local-only; CI does not hold Azure credentials. |
| #257 | PR-AZ-7 · OpenTelemetry → Azure Monitor wiring. New `src/aml_framework/observability/` module with `init_observability()` — lazy-imports `azure.monitor.opentelemetry`, no-op when `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_CONNECTION_STRING` is unset, idempotent + exception-swallowing. Wired from `api/main.py` + `dashboard/app.py`. New `azure-monitor-opentelemetry` in `[azure]` extras. |
| #258 | PR-AZ-8 · Round 16 Phase A docs sync (this entry). |

**Result**: a `terraform apply` against the user's tenant lands the framework end-to-end on Container Apps + Postgres + per-app Key Vault, with the Round-12 lineage chain intact (case_id → Lineage Explorer renders against cloud-deployed dashboard) and the Round-15 Azure data sources working unchanged. Cost ~$33/mo idle on top of the landing zone's $5 baseline. Tests grew 2,076 → 2,084 (+8) across 4 PRs.

**Phase B (queued, not shipped):** Azure OpenAI as 4th assistant backend, Microsoft Sentinel via the platform Log Analytics workspace, Microsoft Purview lineage push. Lives in a future plan.

### Round 17 — Plant coverage + persistence asymmetry + housekeeping (9 PRs, 2026-05-08 → 2026-05-09)

Goal: close the MRM-trustability gap on under-covered specs (us_rtp_fednow, trade_based_ml, uk_app_fraud) by planting ground-truth positives that match each rule's window/threshold semantics, plus a persistence-layer cleanup that surfaced from Azure deployment work.

`#272` was bundled into `#271` and `#280` into `#279` via stacked-PR cascades, so 7 squash commits land on main for these 9 PR numbers.

| PR | Workstream |
|---|---|
| #271 | Flip persistence backend precedence to postgres > cosmos in `_active_backend()`. Helm `api-deployment.yaml` + `dashboard-deployment.yaml` mirror the flip so what `kubectl describe` shows matches what the Python runtime picks under dual-config. One-time WARN log when both `DATABASE_URL` and `COSMOS_ENDPOINT` are set so an operator migrating Cosmos→Postgres sees the silent backend switch in startup logs. New `TestCrudFunctionsRouteToPostgresUnderDualConfig` covers all 7 public CRUD funcs. |
| #272 | (bundled into #271 via stacked-PR cascade) Dashboard startup-log test class (`TestDashboardStartupLogsBackend`) verifies the dashboard pod's `Persistence backend: %s` line emits to the `aml.dashboard` logger. Class-scoped `_restore_sys_modules` fixture prevents streamlit imports leaking into other test files' "no streamlit" assertions. |
| #273 | Document the dashboard ↔ DB persistence asymmetry: terraform-deployed dashboard pods received `COSMOS_ENDPOINT` but not `DATABASE_URL`, silently falling back to local SQLite when `enable_postgres = true`. CLAUDE.md note + `deploy/terraform/README.md` known-issue section pointing at the fix path (Helm side already addressed in #271; Terraform Container Apps side queued). |
| #275 | Plant trade-based ML positives (C0020-C0022) + UK APP fraud positives (C0016-C0019) + the `hs_code_baseline` reference table for over/under-invoicing rule joins. New `is_null` SQL filter operator (with strict bool guard against YAML-quoting accidents) so `phantom_shipping`'s `invoice_id: { is_null: true }` filter compiles correctly. |
| #276 | Plug cross-spec contamination from C0012-C0019 planted positives: at certain seeds the noise loop's 4-week background activity pushed those customers' `unusual_volume_spike` baseline_avg over the 5× ratio threshold, leaking false positives into uk_bank, canadian_schedule_i_bank, canadian_bank, and community_bank. Same `txns = [t for t in txns if t["customer_id"] not in <ids>]` guard pattern that PR #275 used for C0020-C0022, now widened to C0012-C0019. |
| #277 | Align C0012/C0013 RTP plant timestamps with the rule windows: `aggregation_window` uses a sliding `[as_of - parse_window, as_of)` (verified at `src/aml_framework/generators/sql.py:154-163`); the prior C0012 plant at `as_of - timedelta(days=1, hours=1)` was 25h back — 1h outside `first_use_payee_large_amount_rtp`'s 24h window — and C0013's burst at `-1d -14h` was 38h outside `velocity_spike_on_receive_rtp`'s 1h window. Two new window-pinning regression tests catch any future drift. |
| #278 | `.gitignore` additions for `terraform.tfstate*`, `deploy/terraform/*.tfplan`, `_temp/`, `/aml_open_framework/` (embedded git-repo experiment), `uv.lock` — files accumulating untracked across recent rounds that risk an absent-minded `git add -A` polluting a future commit. |
| #279 | Populate `counterparty_id` in the synthetic txn data — declared nullable in `us_rtp_fednow`'s `data_contract` but never emitted by `_make_txn`. Three rules use it: `unusual_send_hour_for_customer_rtp` SELECTs it; `first_use_payee_large_amount_rtp` and `ramp_up_then_drain_rtp` `GROUP BY (customer_id, counterparty_id)`. Without real values, the latter two collapsed every txn into a single `(customer, NULL)` group. Also re-anchored C0012's plant hour to a guaranteed-outside-typical-window value regardless of as_of, so `unusual_send_hour_for_customer_rtp` fires under default `aml run` invocations (was firing only when as_of was at midnight). |
| #280 | (bundled into #279 via stacked-PR cascade) Plant C0023 ("Ramp Source LLC") with 4 small RTP outbounds totaling $1,550 to `CP-RAMP-2026-001` for `ramp_up_then_drain_rtp` coverage. Intentional cross-rule firing: `cyber_enabled_fraud`'s broader `ramp_up_then_drain` rule is a strict superset, so this same plant fires it too — net coverage gain on that spec. |

**Result**: us_rtp_fednow's within-spec coverage on planted customers grew from 0/5 to 4/5 (still needs a customer-contract `device_id` linking column to fire `mule_receiver_fan_out_rtp`); trade_based_ml fires 3/5 of its rules end-to-end on the plants (over_invoicing, phantom_shipping, multiple_invoicing); uk_app_fraud fires 4/4. Cross-spec leak guards at C0012-C0022 stop the noise from those plants nudging unrelated specs' all-txn rules. Tests grew 2,084 → 2,168.

**Out of scope (queued):** `mule_receiver_fan_out_rtp` plant (needs `phone`/`email`/`device_id` linking column on the `customer` contract); `unusual_send_hour_for_customer_rtp` cleanup of the `t.counterparty_id` SELECT now that the column is populated (not strictly needed but tidies the SQL).

## What the Framework Does Today

### For the policy author (CCO / MLRO)
- Authors a versioned `aml.yaml` — every rule cites a specific regulation
- Two-layer validation (JSON Schema + Pydantic cross-references)
- Reusable rule snippet library (`spec/library/`) for ISO 20022 typologies
- Reviewable diff between spec versions (`aml diff`)

### For the data engineer
- Generates SQL, DAG stubs, and control matrix from spec
- 8 supported data sources: synthetic, CSV, Parquet, DuckDB, S3, GCS, Snowflake, BigQuery
- Native ISO 20022 ingestion (pacs.008/009/pain.001/pacs.004)
- Schema validation at load time

### For the analyst (L1/L2)
- 32-page web dashboard with persona-filtered navigation
- Row-click drill-through on every triage table (no more selectbox-below-table)
- Investigation-level review (not just alerts)
- Per-case live SLA + escalation recommendations
- Network-pattern explainability with Mermaid diagrams
- One-click STR submission bundle
- GenAI co-pilot in the sidebar — auto-scoped to current page + run, with citation chips linking back into the dashboard

### For the auditor / regulator
- Append-only decisions ledger with SHA-256 hash chain
- Reproducible runs (same spec + data + seed → identical hashes)
- Regulator-ready evidence ZIP (`aml export`)
- goAML 5.0.2 XML and AMLA RTS JSON exports
- **End-to-end lineage walk-back** (Round 12 + 13): paste any `case_id` → 7-link chain (source file → contract → DuckDB table → rule SQL → matched source rowids → alert → case → STR), each link hash-stamped + reproducible, downloadable as JSON. Surfaces on Audit & Evidence, Case Investigation "Why this fired" panel, the dedicated Lineage Explorer page (#32), AND on Alert Queue / My Queue / Investigations / Customer 360 / Network Explorer / Sanctions Screening / Rule Performance / Run History / Tuning Lab / Today / Executive Dashboard / AI Assistant / Analyst Review Queue inline columns + breadcrumbs (Round 13). STR bundle / FINTRAC audit pack / FinCEN effectiveness pack carry the chain in their manifests. CLI: `aml lineage <case_id>` + `aml verify-decisions`. API: `GET /api/v1/runs/{run_id}/cases/{case_id}/lineage`.

### For the ML modeler
- `python_ref` rule type with security gate (callables restricted to `aml_framework.models.*`)
- MRM bundle generator (SR 26-2 / OCC Bulletin 2026-13 dossiers)
- Tuning Lab — threshold sweep with shadow diff + precision/recall
- Effectiveness Evidence Pack (FinCEN April 2026 NPRM artifact)

### For the operations team
- Multi-tenant dashboard (single process, multiple programs)
- Mobile-responsive layout
- REST API with JWT/OIDC auth, rate limiting, run persistence
- Integrations: Jira, Slack/Teams, SIEM/CEF

## What's NOT in the Framework (by design)

These are documented "won't ship" decisions, not gaps:

- **Generative AI rule-*authoring*** (English → YAML rule). Would destroy the "human-readable spec written by a human" moat that's the framework's whole differentiation. *The dashboard's GenAI assistant (PR-K) is read-only — it answers questions about the spec + run, it does not propose rule edits. Rules stay human-authored.*
- **Native graph DB backend** (Neo4j / TigerGraph). DuckDB-with-graph-views is fast enough for FI-scale datasets, and "one binary, one DuckDB file" deployability is the moat.
- **Alert-scoring ML model in-tree**. Would erode the deterministic re-run guarantee that the MRM bundle (PR #53) builds on. We document the `python_ref` seam; institutions ship their own model.

See `memory/project_round5to9_plan.md` (private) for the full "three new traps" rationale.

## Open Items

- Issue #66 — closed 2026-04-27 (PR #70 mobile-responsive)
- Issue #68 — closed 2026-04-30 (PR #159 / PR-J). Docs-sweep half: only `dashboard-tour.md` had drifted; fixed + added `test_dashboard_tour_coverage.py` so future drift fails CI immediately rather than waiting 30 days for a manual sweep ticket. Mobile half: confirmed already satisfied by `#66` / PR #70.
- No other tracked issues open as of this snapshot

## Round 8 / 9 — Remaining Planned Work

The deep-research-agent's 5-round plan (in `memory/project_round5to9_plan.md`) is now substantially shipped. Round 10 (data-layer hardening) closed the cross-border information-sharing item (9.5) by shipping the spec syntax + CLI + dashboard surface (PR-DATA-10a/b). Status as of 2026-05-02:

| Round | Item | Estimate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8.1 | UK APP-fraud spec | 3d | shipped — Round 7 PR #76 |
| 8.2 | RTP/FedNow push-fraud detector pack | 3d | **shipped** — `examples/us_rtp_fednow/aml.yaml` |
| 8.3 | Regulatory-change diff watcher (regwatch) | 3d | shipped — Round 7 PR #74 |
| 8.4 | Fraud-AML unified case linkage | 3d | **shipped** — `cases/linkage.py` (cyber_enabled_fraud spec is the only consumer; a cross-spec example would deepen this) |
| 8.5 | Beneficial Ownership (BOI) workflow page | 3d | **shipped** — `dashboard/pages/25_BOI_Workflow.py` |
| 9.1 | FINTRAC pre-examination audit pack | 3d | shipped — Round 7 PR #78 |
| 9.2 | Open Compliance API draft | 3d | **shipped** — `api/openapi-compliance.yaml` |
| 9.3 | Guided demo CLI (`aml demo`) | 3d | **shipped** — `cli.py` |
| 9.4 | Synthetic data quality upgrade for new specs | 3d | partial |
| 9.5 | Cross-border information-sharing sandbox (FATF R.18) | 5d | **shipped** — `compliance/sandbox.py` |

The only Round-8/9 item with meaningful work left is 9.4 (~3 engineer-days) — a synthetic-data quality pass for the newer specs (`us_rtp_fednow`, `uk_app_fraud`, `trade_based_ml`) so each ships with its own planted-positives demo run, not just the inherited `community_bank` data. 8.4 is flagged "shipped but partial" because the unified case-linkage code is in but only `cyber_enabled_fraud` exercises it; a fraud↔AML cross-spec example would be the next deepening step.
